Arguments
.file1 and file2 are file name.
.cmd1 and cmd2 are shell commands with their parameters.

Behavior (exactly like the following shell commands)
$> < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2

$> ./pipex infile "grep a1" "wc -w" outfile
equivalent to: 
$> < infile grep a1 | wc -w > outfile


Requirements
.submit a Makefile
.no relink using Makefile
.no unexpected termination (e.g., segmentation fault, bus error, double free, etc.)
